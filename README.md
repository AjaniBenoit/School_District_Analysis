# School_District_Analysis

Analysis of school district using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook

## Overview of Project 

Pandas and Jupyter Notebook were used to complete an analysis of data provided by a school district from excel file Schools Complete [schools_complete.csv](https://github.com/AjaniBenoit/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/schools_complete.csv) and Students Complete [students_complete.csv](https://github.com/AjaniBenoit/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/students_complete.csv). Analysis of the files primarily focused on district school performance in reading and math. Further analysis was completed after concerns raised were raised of academic dishonestly among 9th graders at Thomas High School. The data associated with the 9th graders at Thomas High School was omitted at the request of the School Board.
