# School_District_Analysis

Analysis of school district using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook

## Overview of Project 

Pandas and Jupyter Notebook were used to complete an analysis of data provided by a school district from excel file Schools Complete [schools_complete.csv](https://github.com/AjaniBenoit/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/schools_complete.csv) and Students Complete [students_complete.csv](https://github.com/AjaniBenoit/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/students_complete.csv). Analysis of the files primarily focused on district school performance in reading and math. Further analysis was completed after concerns raised were raised of academic dishonestly among 9th graders at Thomas High School. The data associated with the 9th graders at Thomas High School was omitted at the request of the School Board.

### Purpose 

The purpose of this report is to provide a summary of the performance of schools within district in the subjects of math and reading. 

## Results 
### How is the District Summary Affected?

The testing data in math and reading was converted into a NaN (Not a number) value from 9th graders from Thomas High School and omitted from the calculation percentage of students that passed math, reading and the overall pass rate
